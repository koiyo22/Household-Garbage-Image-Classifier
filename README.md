## Household-Garbage-Image-Classifier
Built and trained a CNN model with TensorFlow and Keras to classify household garbage images into 7 classes: glass, metal, paper, plastic, cardboard, battery, and organic. Trained on 6000+ labeled samples without transfer learning, achieving over 80% accuracy on validation and test datasets. Applied techniques like normalisation, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model generalisation.
